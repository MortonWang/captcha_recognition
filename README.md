# **Overview**

Recognition captcha by CNN+MLP model in PyTorch.The captcha images are generated by [captcha](https://github.com/lepture/captcha),and label is included in the filename respectively.

# **Data**

We provide some data divided into train,val,test folder under `./dataset`,you can run **captcha_gen.py** to generat enough image.The captchas look like this:

![N058](./dataset/test/100_N058.png)  ![WZGP](./dataset/test/90_WZGP.png) ![PBN6](./dataset/test/91_PBN6.png)

# **Model**

We provide two trained models under `./model`,you can run **model_test.py** to load and obtain the accuracy of the appointed data without training.

# **Requirements**
* Python:2.7
* Torch:1.0.1
* captcha:0.3
